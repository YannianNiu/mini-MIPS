# mini-MIPS
This a project for Architecture course (fall, 2020, ECNU). I created a simple MIPS simulator in Java.

In the file folder project_requirment, you can see the detailed requirments and descriptions of the project in the file Fall2020.pdf. You can also see the instruction set of MIPS in mips.pdf.

sample.txt is an example of inputs of this project, and disassembly.txt and simulation.txt is the corresponding outputs.

We packaged the program into a jar file. If you want to test the example inputs, just run the mini-MIPS.jar file directly. If you want to test new inputs, please change the name of the input file to sample.txt.
